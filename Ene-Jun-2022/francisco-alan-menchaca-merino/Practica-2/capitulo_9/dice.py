"""9-14. Dice: The module random contains functions that generate random
numbers in a variety of ways. The function randint() returns an integer
in the range you provide. The following code returns a number between
1 and 6:
from random import randint
x = randint(1, 6)

Make a class Die with one attribute called sides, which has a default 
value of 6. Write a method called roll_die() that prints a random number 
between 1 and the number of sides the die has. Make a 6-sided die and
roll it 10 times.
Make a 10-sided die and a 20-sided die. Roll each die 10 times"""
