I've learning that python can do everything as other lenguages can
also i've learned that dictionaries are more easy/useful for certain things than lists or arrays,
Python is a easier lenguage to learn to program than others, also the way that python reads all python files
is a lot diferent, i mean, it does one check to everything instead of doing line by line like java for example.

I've learned about classe, loops, dictionaries, lists, modules, importing things, also implement some methods.
