# 5-4. Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and write an if-else chain.

# • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
# • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
# • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points for shooting the alien")
else:
    print("You just earned 10 points")
