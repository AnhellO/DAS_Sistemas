# 5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.
# Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
# • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player
# just earned 5 points.
# • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails.
# (The version that fails will have no output.)

alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points")

# ----------------------------------------------------

alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'yellow':
    print("You just earned 5 points")
