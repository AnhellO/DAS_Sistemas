"""6-3. Glossary: A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary.
However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.
• Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous
chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their
meanings as values.
• Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might
print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word
on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the
newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning
pair in your output."""
